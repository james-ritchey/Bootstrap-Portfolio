                    My name is James Ritchey and I've been working with computers for as long as I can remember.  
                    I've been programming since I was around 13 years old, making simple games with the GameMaker engine,
                    and since then my interest has grown into a passion as I continue working on 
                    expanding my knowledge in the Computer Science field.  While working on personal projects I've
                    gained experience in everything from C#, C++, and Java to 3D modeling and texture creation, and I 
                    keep learning more every day.  Currently I'm working through learning frontend development and 
                    web design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in computers started while watching my dad play RollerCoaster Tycoon on the family computer, I 
                    thought it was so cool, and since then I've been curious about every aspect about them.  Whether it's how 
                    each component works to building them from scratch, to how the software on them runs, I want to know as much
                    as I can.  I hope to one day have a career in software development, since creating things from scratch is 
                    something I love to do, though I enjoy pretty much every aspect of programming.
